    <p><h3>
       Welcome to my website!<br>
       This is where my all personal mathematical endeavours go. <br>
       I started in early 2020 by asking myself "What if ..." questions and <br>
       figuring out solutions to them. One question often leads to another, <br>
       quickly turning into something much bigger than anticipated. <br>
       <br>
       Over time I will upload questions and solutions to them, as well as <br>
       all the other things I thought of and solved previously, rewritten to <br>
       more be understandable. <br>
       <br>
       None of this is meant to be 'serious' mathematics and is not written <br>
       to be such. It is merely how I decided to solve hobby-maths.</h3></p>
